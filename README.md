Verilog Projects

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository contains a collection of Verilog hardware description language (HDL) projects.
It is intended to support the development of skills in digital logic design, hardware modeling, and simulation-based verification.

Projects in this repository explore key concepts such as:
  - Combinational logic design
  - Sequential logic using clocks and resets
  - Finite State Machines (FSMs)
  - Pipelining and control logic
  - Modular and hierarchical design practices
  - Testbench development and simulation

The goal is to gain hands-on experience building digital systems from simple building blocks to more complex components.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
  - Icarus Verilog â€” for compiling and running simulations
  - GTKWave â€” for waveform viewing and debugging
  - VSCode â€” for editing Verilog code with HDL extensions

ðŸ§  About Verilog
Verilog is a hardware description language used to model and implement real digital systems, including CPUs, GPUs, memory controllers, and specialized accelerators.
Learning Verilog strengthens understanding of hardware architecture, hardware validation, and digital system design, which are essential skills in computer engineering and semiconductor fields.
